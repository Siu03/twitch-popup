# HTML streaming Popup

== This is my base for streaming/obs social media popups ==

Javascript code was taken from penscript, and the project was heavily inspired by Dignitas's Streamers Popup. This project is my solution to advertise my social media on-stream.

## How do I use this?

Change your social's handles in the Javascript file before using it in your streaming software, if not, you may have problems with names not updating.

I use OBS, but feel free to use it in any other streaming software.
1. Download the project's source and unzip it on a folder.
2. Add a Browser source to your scene in OBS
3. Check the "Local File" box in Browser Properties
4. Click "Browse" and go to the projects folder
5. Select the HTML file and click OK.

And that's it. You now have a cool popup for your streams.
